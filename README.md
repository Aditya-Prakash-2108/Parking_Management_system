# Parking_Management_system
This is a web application which digitalizes management of car parking

Acknowledgement
Managing Prakings is a big task and involves a lot of “people power”. We have made a website to manage 
everything digitally. Our website scans every car and gives them a unique ID using Quick Response code 
(QR). The website lists every car and calculates their ‘In time’ when the car arrives and ‘Out Time’ when
the car leaves the parking. Parking spaces will have IOT enabled devices which will keep track of the 
number of cars entering the parking lot and the number of spaces left. Using this feature, we can replace 
people with smart machines.

General
In modern times, time is what matters the most to people. Everything we do is directly or indirectly an effort 
to spend less time on daily things and more on personal and professional growth. People wait in lines for 
parking and face a lot of discomfort while dealing with the manual entry and exit section of the Parking. It’s 
the need of the hour to have a proper digitized parking management system for the better use of time and 
‘people power’ also efficient utilization of the digital world.
Here, in this we explore the parking management system website’s basic features like scanning the car, adding 
the counter for entry of the car and storing everything in database along with the real time.

Problem Statement
In today’s world everything is being digitized except for parking spaces. In addition, a lot of men's work is 
required for this operation, which requires a lot of expenditure. Therefore, it is necessary to create a system 
that shows clearly which parking space is available in any lane. Smart Parking is now the most well-liked 
Smart City concept. 
To reduce traffic and parking hassles, a number of Smart Parking projects have been launched in numerous 
cities throughout the world. Smart Parking is regarded as the low barrier option because to its simple 
installation, scalability, efficiency, and flexibility. It is ideal for contemporary cities that want to use the power 
of IoT to potentially benefit their residents.
Due to two key trends—increasing urbanization and a rise in car ownership—secure parking spots are in 
increasingly high demand. The drivers' parking experience is being negatively impacted by the rising 
number of vehicles on the road. Drivers that use the conventional parking system suffer significant losses in 
terms of money, productivity, and time spent looking for parking spaces in heavily populated locations.

Features
This project will help users park their cars using a nontraditional, more of a digital way. Admin can also see 
the details and the number of cars parked which reduces margin of error. Some of the features of this web 
application are:

  i. Login and signup option for user
  ii. Keep track of the cars parked.
  iii. Give every car a unique Id using QR codes
  iv. Display the details of the car which is currently present in the parking
  v. Remove the car when it leaves the parking
  vi. Admin can see the time of entry as well as exit of each and every car.
  vii. Users can add their information in their respective id (like photo of the car, name of the car, etc.).
